    <td>This is where my boyfriend wants to move too later on in life which I will most likely join him in this move. I want to move to the East but wasnt sure where and I knew I didn't want to live in Californa but close to it. I would like to visit before I decide I would move there so that I can make sure it is the perfect place for me.</td>

 <td>Californa</td>
 <td>L.A.</td> 
<td>Growing up I watched a lot of youtube and most of the people lived in Californa. It always look to be my perfect place and want to live there for the longest time. I also wantd to be a film maker its a pretty good place for that. Sense then I've changed a lot and learn it's really expensive to live there but definitly would live to vist Californa at some point and hopefully more than once. </td>

    <td>Italy</td>
    <td>Venice</td> 
    <td> In highschool we had a forgin exchange from Italy who I became very close too. She didn't really like it all to much there hence why she now lives in America but she did speak well of Venice so I figured sense I wanted to travel Europe that would be one of the places. I've seen a lot if it from movies, shows, and just random things online and it looks to be very beautiful. I'd. love to list just to see where my friend got to grow up at as well as experiance all the art they have to offer.</td> 
    <tr>
    <td>Leeward Islands</td>
    <td>Bora Bora</td> 
    <td>I've seen many of the youtube creators I grew up watching visit this island and made it look straight out of a dream. I love swiming and the idea of the ocean but I hate not being able to see thre the water im swimming in. The water is really clear in Bora Bora and you can get into the ocean from your room which allows me to get away from the crowd you normally have on vacation that I hate.</td>
